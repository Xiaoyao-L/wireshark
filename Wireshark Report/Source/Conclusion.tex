\section{Conclusion}
Through the analysis of vendors information in the project, the most striking result is that when analyzing the data, for both access points and stations, even if different databases are called, there still exist many MAC addresses that are not recognized by the database. This may require a database that are more optimized or updated for the growing number of MAC addresses typed. Based on the analysis of data, project also obtain the proportion of vendors for access points and stations in different regions. Combining with the analysis of nationality, for delft, American vendors account for a large proportion followed by China. For the local vendors in the Netherlands, they may only have one share of access points.
