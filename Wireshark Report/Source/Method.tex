\section{Method}
In the project, data were captured around the dormitories and campus. The MAC address prefixes was extracted by python program and by comparing the information with Wireshark manufacturer database, corresponding vendor type was obtained and summarized into a histogram. By collating vendor company information, the project was able to determine which country's routers and mobile devices were more popular in the Netherlands. 
\subsection{Hypothesis}
By analyzing the data collected in different regions, the project can obtain the types of vendors both the access point and station in the three regions and the number of users using such vendors in the region. For dormitory No.1 where the residents are mostly the same age as graduate students, the project initially assumed that Apple and Google would account for a high proportion. For dormitory No.2 where the residents are mostly middle aged and elderly people, since the project participants are not local people, it is speculated that there may be local brands or those with high popularity like Google or Cisco. For the campus, the preliminary hypothesis is similar the result of dormitory No.1.
